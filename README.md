# Guesser game 🎮🎯

I've created console based mini project called guesser game by using classes, objects, methods, loops and control statements[core java basics].

1. Here, the Guesser will guess the number within the specified range and tells it to the Umpire.

2. Umpire stores that number and asks other players to guess the number that guesser has guessed. And then, he will store the numbers from each players in the form of an array.

3. Finally Umpire will compare the guesser number with the players , after undergoing multiple rounds, he will announce the final winner.
